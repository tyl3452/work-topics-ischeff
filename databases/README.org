Homework and Async. Work
Please note that all students will complete the same one required homework assignment. Students will also complete one or more of the asynchronous assignments of their choice. There are five asynchronous assignments at varying difficulty levels.

Homework

Homework Assignment: Write a SQL query that retrieves the following records: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vy6VDlqOZy8aV7zceGFSJNbbpFH06z1G/view?usp=sharing
Your SQL JOIN query will retrieve from the tables shared with you the records of all of the unexcused period attendance absences in the school for the week of 1-24-22 sorted by student last name ascending. You will use the resulting table of results, which you can call allCuts, in the async assignment. Consider a cut to be any instance of a student scanning into the building and being marked absent in a class. You will retrieve only the first name, last name, student ID, grade, scanTime, status, date, courseSection, attendance, period, and teacher.

Skills Learned: SELECT, JOIN, ORDER BY, aliases, intro. to SQL Functions

Hint #1: You want to do an inner join on the periodAtt table and the scan table, but you have no unique primary key and foreign key to join on. Would it be possible to join on both the studentID and the date? 

The syntax might look like this:

SELECT * 
FROM table1 AS t1 
INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 
ON t1.studentID=t2.studentID AND t1.date=t2.date

Hint #2: Before you can make the inner join work on the studentID and date, you need to update the date in one table or the other so that the formats match. How can we modify the date programmatically within a query? substr() can extract a string from the first character to first instance of the ' ' character, and instr() can return the position of the first occurrence of ' '. Could these two be used together to create a new date field? 

The syntax might look like this:

substr(myField, 1, instr(myField,' ')) 

Hint #3: Now we are ready to retrieve only the relevant fields for our records. Some of the fields will exist in both tables, so you will need to specify what table the field is coming from if it shares a name with one in the other table. 

This is done with the following syntax:

SELECT myTable1.myField1, myTable2.myField2... 

It is necessary to write this query that returns the records for the allCuts table prior to completing the asynchronous work as most of the asynchronous assignments use the allCuts table.
