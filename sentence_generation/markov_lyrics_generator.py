# hat-tip to Liam Baum and Andrew Healey, a British software engineer, who have both implemented Markov Chains in ways that proved invaluable to our group!
# You can find Liam's (super awesome) lyric generator here on his repo: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/work_csci70900-mrbombmusic/tree/master/ds/markov
# And Healey Codes version here: https://github.com/healeycodes/markov-chain-generator

# This function takes as inputs your corpus (a string of text) and the state size and returns a dictionary that is a Markov model of the corpus

    # Here, state size is another way of saying the "n" in "n-gram":

        # If state size is 1, the model will build a dictionary in which each word in the corpus
        # is a key, and the words that follows a given word--anywhere in the corpus--are the values.

        # If state size is 2, the model will build a dictionary in which each pair of words in the corpus
        # is a key, and the words that follows that pair are the keys.
